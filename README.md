XMonad Config for Haskell

Some Haskell Notes:
Lists: []
++      concatinate lists
List Functions:
head,tail,last,init,length,null,reverse,take,drop,maximum,minimum,sum,product,elem

Texas Ranges:
[x..y]
Functions:
cycle,repeat,replicate

List Comprehension:
 [ x | x <- [1..10]]  read this as "x such that x is an element of [1..10]" (<- is ment to look like set theory "element of" symbol)
 [ x | bool1, bool2, bool3 ]  general form comprehension returns another list
 [ 1 | _ <- [1,2,3,4]]  use _ when not using actual elements
